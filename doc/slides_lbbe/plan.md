# Réunion méthodo 14 juin 2022

Check with Anna if ok to present.

Done
- hawkes : multiples points axis, density function, interactions
- functions basis

Next
- inferrence target (a) and LASSO with B,G formulas (& maybe V,Bhat, at least for the sup), no kernel histogram
- manipulate G to get to generic formula
- introduce convolution / correlation
- sum of point differences
- Bhat with sup
- kernel case formulas : outch

* inferrence overview :
	- values to compute then lasso.
	- convolution & cross correlation with gif from wikipedia
	- maybe add 1 slide with where these values come from (BRP18)
* list of values:
	- simple ones + value properties
	- for others, how to end up on `sup_of_point_difference`
* list of shapes to compute
* G for no kernel : trapezoid with parameters
* kernel case : adding other primitives
* generalize :
	- polynomials definition
	- convolution operator
	- auxiliary stuff : clamp, correlation, etc
	- demo of plot for debug
